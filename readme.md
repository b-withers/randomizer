<h1 class="text-center">RANDOMIZER!!</H1>
<br>
<p>Randomizer is a web app that allows you to enter items into an array, and upon button click the array will randomize and then be split into two separate arrays! The Array is currently filled with numbers 1-9, but can easily be changed in the script.js file.</p>
<p>The results are displayed on the dom using document.getElementById().innerHTML via JavaScript</p>
<p>Each time the randomize button is clicked the results are updated</p>
